# typeracer_champion

Do YOU type slowly?
Do YOU even type quickly?

Above all, do YOU lose too many typeracer games?

Well behold, a way of besting every single one of your opponents, by employing the digital typeracer champion!

Advantages:
- Can edit speed, by changing the interval value
- Simple GUI
- You will be a winner every race (given that your opponent is not using an equal or superior script)

Disadvantages:
- Races against real players disabled due to typeracer TOS
- Can bug out if clicks are made while the program is running
  - This is due to the keyboard and mouse inputs being targeted to the wrong screen
- Speed caps out at 500 wpm, this is typeracer's limit before disqualification
- Currently cannot use the "race with friends" option
